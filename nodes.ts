The third comment describes a recent price cap set by the Hungarian government on petrol, which will cause gas station owners to lose money if they sell petrol at the capped price, and a new regulation to prevent them from closing or not selling petrol. \n\nThe fourth comment discusses the feasibility of Bezos selling his large amount of Amazon stock, suggesting that the process would need to be done over multiple years in order to avoid a drop in stock price. The fifth comment questions why companies in financial trouble don't usually sell stocks when prices drop, suggesting that borrowing is a preferred option due to the better terms they can get.

Instead, reducing economic activity is the most effective cure. Some suggest that interest rates are the basic way to fight inflation, along with curbing government spending and borrowing, and removing limits and retardants on production. However, it is also acknowledged that the government cannot simply stop printing money without making huge policy shifts that have enormous macroeconomic consequences.\n\nThe second set of comments focuses on the economic situation in Russia, with the author providing several metrics on the country's economy, demographics, and governance. While Russia does face structural economic and demographic problems, the author notes that most things have been consistently improving over the last twenty years. However, the author also predicts that Russia will just fumble along, maintaining its mediocre position and never realizing its full potential.\n\nThe third set of comments revolves around questions about the economy and finance, with the author seeking resources to better understand the complexities of money and finance. The comments suggest various resources, including a non-dumbed-down account of the 2008 financial crisis, and the movie The Big Short, which is treated more as a documentary. Nevertheless, some of the comments argue that understanding technical aspects of money and finance is not enough to fully comprehend the economy, as it is a collection of decisions made by society.",

Some express concern that landowners will be unfairly burdened by the tax, while others argue that the tax is necessary to address inequality and encourage economic growth. The potential impact on low-income individuals is also discussed, with some commenters suggesting that LVT could have negative consequences for retirees and those emotionally attached to their homes. \n\nOne theme that emerges is the concept of land value versus land price, with some arguing that an LVT should be based on value rather than price. The role of zoning laws and regulation in LVT is also debated, with some arguing that the tax should not limit what one can do with their land, and others suggesting that it is necessary to address the negative impact of certain types of land use. Finally, the issue of fairness and equity is central to many comments, with divergent opinions on how an LVT could be implemented to best achieve these goals.",

One commenter questions the definition of rich and how it is determined and measuring wealth via GDP per capita. Another talks about the flaws in the Gini coefficient and how it can fail to capture the wealth distribution in a society accurately. Another commenter acknowledges the decline in global poverty but questions the validity of the statistics used and encourages using a different metric. They argue that current times are the best for human beings because of advancements, even though the ways to measure poverty are very different. In addition, the comments discuss the treatment of poverty and what solutions to address it would look like. Cash transfers are viewed as an inadequate solution by some, while others suggest redistribution to raise median incomes. There is also a focus on the negative externalities of overpopulation and the impact on society.

Some argue that the current economic focus on large businesses and their wealthy owners ignores the value of smaller-scale, more locally-targeted farming and land use practices. Georgism, which places taxes on immutable land features rather than on things like fertility that can be created or destroyed, is highlighted as one approach that could encourage smaller-scale, more diverse land use. Others also point out that throughout history, there has been a recognized need for large urban centers to maintain certain cultural institutions, like orchestras and theater companies, which are sometimes necessary to support the existence of other businesses and contribute to the idea of a thriving \"consumer class.\"",

One author expresses their addiction to these illusions and mentions their surprise and disappointment when printed versions of the illusions do not appear to move. They speculate that their brain may interpret printed images differently from on-screen images. The other author is intrigued by this phenomenon but does not have any suggestions for why it might be happening.\n\nBoth authors are interested in discussing the science behind optical illusions and wonder why the printed versions do not appear to move. They both suggest possible explanations for this phenomenon but do not come to any definitive conclusions. The discussion also touches on magic eye illusions, which work equally well on screen and in print, but this is not seen as a solution to the problem at hand. The tone of the conversation is curious and open-minded, with the authors welcoming each other's insights and speculation.",

The commenter gives an example of how trains could make local stops and still have a reasonable travel time. They also argue that diagonal railways would not necessarily be more efficient. The commenter suggests that the build costs of straight parallel railways would be a great cost savings.\n\nThe second comment discusses the feasibility of high-speed train travel and suggests that it has never been optimized for line scenarios. The commenter argues that, just as cheap airlines make travel accessible, optimized train lines could make high-speed train travel a reality. They believe that even if the travel time was increased to 40-50 minutes, it would still be an acceptable option for travel.\n\nThe fourth comment explores the math behind laying out a straight railway line. The commenter suggests that there might need to be stations at each mile for a 9-mile section of railway, although they are not sure of the exact number of stations. They express an interest in modeling the system further and suggest that they are an amateur in this area of expertise. \n\nThe final comment discusses different ways of estimating distance, including using time zones to make rough guesses. They suggest that knowing the difference in time zones between two locations can help make a rough estimate of the distance between them.",

One author questioned how paradoxical the dark sky is, arguing that \"not bright\" and \"dark\" convey the same meaning. Another author engaged with the idea of life beyond Earth and considered the possibility that there may be other intelligent civilizations in the universe. They noted that a million years is enough time to colonize the entire galaxy, so either humanity is fortunate, or we have yet to face an obstacle that another civilization has to encounter, possibly even a galactic filter.\n \nConversely, some authors discussed interstellar warfare and the ability to detect and defend against an attack. Defense was thought to be more powerful than attack due to the time it takes to send weapons or intercept an electronic signal. One commentator wondered if building a binary system with two close stars and a terrestrial planet could provide a boost for interstellar travel. Another author questioned the feasibility of the double sunset phenomenon, arguing that this should be more easily observed if the Earth was round versus flat.

The first commenter regards \"Truth Bombs\" as a waste of public funding and suggest that they only work for those who don't need them. They propose to prime them with the workings of an entire language and drop them on all countries that don't speak it for universal communication. The second comment discusses the ACX invisible orbiting space station that can drop Truth Bombs anywhere in the world. They explain that each bomb bay consists of 25 Truth Bombs that must be armed with a truth. The bombs will cause people within 100 m of the impact point to believe that truth for 24 hours if they did not do so before.\n\nThe third commenter explains that the range of railgun projectiles is limited by ballistics, meaning that a projectile without any power can remain airborne for a limited period. For instance, to cover 110 nm, the railgun velocity requires about 4,000 metres per second. Even the fastest conventional guns only achieve half the velocity, and the projectile should survive launch at that speed. The fourth comment talks about Iraq's Chemical Weapons programs. The commenter suggests that Iraq had active chemical weapons programs up to 1998 when a bombing campaign was carried out by the Clinton administration that was more effective than anticipated. As a result, Saddam abandoned further WMD programs primarily to get sanctions lifted. In domestic and Iranian audiences, they tried to convince them that they had secretly remained with WMDs to deter rebel and Iranian aggression.\n\nThe fifth commenter discusses Russia's stockpiles and mentions that it is hard to get an accurate numerical estimate of them. They clarify that the stockpiles make use of simple unguided munitions, and they have large deposits that they can manufacture locally or buy from friendly dictatorships. The sixth commenter notes that the bombs in discussion are generally called atomic rather than nuclear, which is where we are headed. Although they mention that there are not enough nukes these days to destroy the entire world, Russia currently has about 1,500 active nukes aimed mostly at the US.",

One commenter points out that slavery still exists in various forms around the world, including in several African countries and the domestic servant industry in Southeast Asia. Another argues that the fight against Southern slavery is no longer relevant and that the focus should be on addressing contemporary issues. A third suggests that drafting people into the army could have been avoided by offering higher wages, but acknowledges that the issue is complex.\n\nSeveral commenters touch on the difficulties of obtaining identification, especially for those who are poor or homeless. They advocate for easier access to ID services and waiving fees for obtaining identification. One commenter compares voter ID laws to Soviet-era policies that required official permits to change residence areas.\n\nFinally, one commenter references population control policies in India that offered incentives for sterilization. They express doubt that such policies had any impact on IQ levels. Overall, the comments suggest that social and political issues are complex and cannot be easily addressed through simplistic thought experiments or oversimplified solutions.",

One notes the high cost of buying a house compared to renting, while another comments on the difference between how landlords treat their tenants; landlords for rich people continue to rent out houses, while those who rent to poor people typically get out of the market as soon as they can. Another author highlights the value of location and how it is almost completely unique, making it hard to imagine housing prices falling if the marginal unit of housing in Manhattan were destroyed.

Another comment asks what is the most important profession one could take up in the US, suggesting that it is law because lawyers could easily end up in cases that have a significant impact and they often save people doing important work from be run over by power run amok.\n\nLastly, an author mentions a Dutch court ruling that Uber is an employer and not a mediator, which will have consequences such as providing fixed contracts and paying for pensions. Another platform company lost a similar case and did not change its practices. Uber has the option to appeal.",

The first comment likens the American lack of interest in soccer, and particularly the World Cup, to the fact that Americans favour winners, and their team is not considered a winner. The commenter highlights that Americans love an underdog, but only if the underdog actually wins. The second comment regards the World Cup too, however, describes the excitement and unpredictability of the tournament, citing Germany's surprising defeat to Japan in a previous round. The concerns are hypothetical and extend beyond the sure things and favourites. Finally, the comment goes on to provide a real-time report of the Japan versus Croatia game.\n\nThe third comment relates to the Met Gala and cultural events in Oakland, LA, and Miami. The author believes it would take a great deal of time and luck for Oakland to host something like the Met Gala or the Oscars. Miami is seen as a more viable option, but time will tell. The fourth comment takes a dig at the political candidates in the mayoral elections in London and New York. The commenter notes the unlikely names of some of the candidates and comments on the Bookies' predictions. The focus is mainly on the humorous aspect of the political landscape in the two cities, rather than offering any substantial insight.",

Mask mandates are seen as close to useless, while lockdowns are only slightly useful but come at a high cost. The best course of action is the availability of vaccines developed by Moderna and BionTech as well as J&J and AstraZenica. \n\nOn the mutation of the virus spike protein, one comment highlighted that it cannot mutate too much because it must conform closely to a human protein that isn't mutating at all. \n\nThe comments on Ivermectin demonstrate how complicated it is to form opinions on medical treatments and how the use of non-reliable sources such as VAERS can lead to confusion. Finally, one comment analyzed the issue of CDC-reported influenza deaths, pointing out that patient selection bias and a biased data source could affect the accuracy of data.",

The Sequences by Eliezer are also mentioned, with the opinion that they are valuable but too long and challenging for some readers. \n\nOther comments focus on specific math topics and resources, such as books on functional analysis, non-linear causality, and arithmetic. Some commenters also engage in philosophical debates about the nature of math, discussing the immateriality of numbers and the concept of wisdom of the crowds. \n\nFinally, some comments delve into statistical concepts such as brier scores and the nature of cyclical patterns. One commenter notes that cyclical patterns are rare because they imply a mix of positive and negative correlations that can lead to strange predictions, while another clarifies the proper use of logarithmic error terms in scoring prediction accuracy.",

One recommendation is the Project Euler, which offers challenging math problems for programming enthusiasts, although one commenter found it to be too math-heavy. Another suggestion is the nand2tetris course, which teaches how to build a basic computer from scratch using simple logic gates, and is highly recommended for those who want a more wide-ranging understanding of computing. \n\nThere is also a discussion on the best resources for learning math, with recommendations including Thurston's 3 manifolds and Strogatz's Nonlinear Dynamics, although it is noted that individual mathematical tastes differ. One commenter also discusses the use of dual numbers in programming to calculate both a function and its derivative in a single forward pass. A discussion on the nature of mathematical concepts arises, with one commenter referring to them as immaterial but real, similar to names or the stream-of-consciousness. \n\nFinally, there is a discussion on the importance of decimal arithmetic and mental calculation. One commenter argues that the intuitions developed from working with decimal arithmetic are useful for understanding abstract concepts, while another notes the decline in the popularity of mental calculation after the introduction of mechanical calculators in the late 19th century.",

The first comment defines and discusses non-linear causality as a form of causation where cause and effect can flow in a bidirectional fashion between two or more elements or systems, leading to self-reinforcing or self-amplifying processes through feedback. The second comment questions the rarity of cyclical patterns and provides an example of business cycles being a misnomer caused by the illusion of cycle pareidolia. The author suggests that the term \"business cycle\" is a misnomer because it implies that several consecutive periods of above-average growth mean that the probability of a recession is higher, when in fact it is lower. The third comment provides a statistical reason why strongly cyclical patterns are uncommon, as they imply a bizarre mix of positive and negative correlations and can make predictions difficult. \n\nOverall, the comments convey a sense of skepticism toward the concept of cycles and emphasize the complexity of causality and prediction. The authors challenge assumptions around cycles and suggest that non-linear causality and other factors can complicate our understanding of patterns.",

There are comments about the history of human civilisation, the concept of race and tribalism, and whether certain tribes or cultures can claim to be the \"first\" to have occupied a certain area. \n\nSome of the commenters express frustration with the idea that we know relatively little about the vast majority of human prehistory. They suggest that it is not unreasonable to speculate about what might have occurred during that time. Others suggest that, on an evolutionary timescale, the differences between groups of humans or even between species are relatively small. \n\nThere are also comments that discuss the idea of race and tribal identity. One commenter suggests that our current understanding of race is based heavily on the past few hundred years, and that future societies might conceptualise race differently. Another comment suggests that tribes of humans have been distinct from each other for thousands of years, and that physical differences exist between different groups. Finally, there are comments about the idea of tribes being the \"first\" to occupy a certain area. Some commenters suggest that, given the constant fighting and movement of human groups, it seems unlikely that any culture or tribe could truly be the \"first\" to claim an area.",

One author questions whether all languages have a word for consciousness or if the concept is only relevant in certain cultures. Another supports the idea that the development of writing systems contributed to the emergence of consciousness. A third argues that sophisticated cultures create shared narratives that interpret reality. A fourth raises questions about relativism and evaluating newsrooms. A fifth highlights the role of status and competition in language use, suggesting that language for humans is primarily a status game rather than a tool for information sharing.\n\nThese comments reflect a diversity of ideas, but they all touch on the complexities of language and how it influences and reflects human experience. From the emergence of consciousness to the nature of knowledge creation and transmission to the social dynamics of language interaction, the comments demonstrate the rich and multifaceted ways in which language shapes our understanding of the world. While some of the themes are rooted in philosophical reflections on language, others draw on social science research to illuminate the role of language in human social dynamics. Ultimately, the comments suggest that understanding language is key to understanding the human experience.",

Many commenters acknowledge that media outlets tend to push a certain narrative, often by selectively reporting information and omitting relevant context. Some suggest that this behavior qualifies as lying, even if it does not directly involve stating false facts. The definition of a lie is brought up often, with some arguing that the technical definition is too narrow for practical use. Additionally, some commenters express concern about the crisis of authority in the media and intellectual world, as it becomes increasingly difficult to discern what sources of information can be trusted.\n\nThere are a few disagreements within the group, mostly surrounding the definition of a lie and whether or not media outlets intentionally deceive their audience. Some argue that the media is cautious because they know that any mistakes will be quickly scrutinized by internet experts. However, others point out that media outlets do make bold statements that are sometimes wrong or uninformed. Despite these differences in opinion, most commenters seem to be grappling with the issue of how to determine what sources of information they can trust in a world where truth is increasingly hard to discern.",

In the first comment, the use of Greek letters to name variants of a virus is critiqued for being needlessly elitist and arbitrary, given that most people lack knowledge of the Greek alphabet. A more useful option would be to use place names, as they create a strong association with the variant. Similarly, the second comment discusses the difficulties of romanizing Chinese words due to different preferences and limitations and notes that tone marks may not be that useful for most readers.\n\nAnother topic addressed by the comments is the interpretation of texts and the nuances of language. In the third comment, the author notes the various meanings of the Greek words used in the Bible and how they may be understood in a non-chronological sense. The fourth comment highlights the misuse of language, specifically the incorrect claim that \"mesa\" is the opposite of \"meta,\" and how certain terms gain acceptance within certain communities.\n\nThe final comment is a playful reference to a fictional society that uses a numbered system to shorthand certain traits, which in turn allows them to insult others in an efficient but coded way.",

Additionally, the author inquires about resources to learn Low German, including beginner texts and shows to watch in the language.\n\nThe second comment seeks advice on which languages, beyond English, have vibrant contemporary literary scenes, with a preference for non-Indoeuropean languages. The author suggests that having a stimulating literary scene would be a strong motivator for learning a new language.\n\nThe final comment questions the necessity of reading original works when there are quality translations available. The author expresses satisfaction with translations of works from closely-allied languages, and believes that translations deteriorate the further the source language is from English. \n\nOverall, the comments express a desire to engage with language and culture beyond one's own, while also displaying a pragmatic sensibility towards language learning and cultural exchange.",

They are curious about the process of conversion and whether they would need to promise to follow certain rules or attend a synagogue. The second commenter is nervous about seeing a therapist who is Jewish (and a former rabbi) because they are an atheist raised in the Jewish faith, and they worry that the conversation will turn to religion and God, rather than staying focused on therapy. The third comment explores the topic of the name of God (Jehovah), its origins and use.

The comment on nerd culture examines the distinction between being a fan and being a nerd and how the latter builds an identity around their fandom. \n\nAnother comment on empathy and Asperger's Syndrome discusses the individual's difficulty in empathizing with others and wonders if normal people can truly experience what it's like to be in other people's situations. A comment on art and media criticizes the quality of recent movies and television shows despite the abundance of new material and adaptations of quality sources. \n\nOther comments delve into more specific subjects like cultural stereotypes, food and drink trends, and expertise and criticism.

Several other comments express confusion at the appeal of certain cultural phenomena such as hard seltzer or the lack of distinctive styles in the 2000s, or discuss the relative worth of various forms of art. Finally, one comment offers a humorous perspective on the prevalence of television in American culture, suggesting it functions as a kind of metacult that serves many people's needs for explanations of the world.

People's taste preferences and choices can also be influenced by their social group, as seen with comments about \"Basic McThings\" and even hard seltzer, which can be viewed as a trend for college kids. However, the complexity of taste also relates to cultural associations, snobbery, and sophistication. For instance, one commentator is less interested in being sophisticated about wine and says that people don't necessarily need to be embarrassed about their taste preferences either way. The commentators acknowledge that most people have diverse preferences and that people's taste preferences can evolve, moving them in new and different directions over time.",

Another wonders why there hasn't been a distinctive style since the turn of the century, theorizing that it may be due to the internet or a historical aberration. Yet another commenter speculates that the current era may be viewed as an uninteresting interlude between more historically significant periods. \n\nThere are also comments related to the arts - one commenter argues that modern \"illustrators\" will be more remembered than \"artists\" in the future, while another discusses the role of beauty and ugliness in art. There is also speculation about why modern music and culture may be less complex or sophisticated than those of past eras, with one commenter suggesting that the availability of data and marketing may lead to a homogenization of products.

However, another commenter suggests that normie empathy may be an unwritten social contract rather than genuine empathy, and they may only feel discomfort when their illusion of empathy is broken. \n\nThis group of comments also touches on the topic of social hierarchy, with one commenter noting that uncool kids may be unwilling or unable to play-act socially and therefore remain uncool.

They are hesitant to demand too much from their partner, but are also hoping for more support in raising their young child. Despite the range of topics discussed, all comments share a desire for more compassionate and thorough care for those dealing with ADHD, and for increased understanding and support for those with ADHD and their loved ones.",

The child has been experiencing diarrhea for the past three months. The author is concerned and finds that the pediatrician's explanation that the child will eventually grow out of the condition unsatisfactory. The author is exploring different solutions, including eliminating dairy from the child's diet.

Some people are hesitant to explore these states too deeply, for fear of negative consequences or simply because they don't find it necessary. Others have had profound experiences that have helped them grow and evolve, but caution against recommending these experiences to everyone, as they can be disorienting and not suitable for everyone. The discussion also touches on the reliability of sense perception and the idea of prior beliefs shaping our experiences.\n\nAnother theme that emerges is the importance of subjective experiences and individual differences. People have varying abilities to imagine things, from visual images to sensory experiences like taste and smell. There are also differences in how people respond to meditation practices, with some finding them transformative and others experiencing negative effects like anxiety and depersonalization. The importance of validating subjective experiences and acknowledging individual differences is emphasized, as people's experiences can't be reduced to statistical data or objective measures.\n\nFinally, there is a thread running through the comments about the limitations of language and the difficulty of accurately describing subjective experiences. People often struggle to convey what they have experienced to others who have not shared the same experiences. This can lead to misunderstandings and skepticism from those who have not had similar experiences.

Some comments point out that the approval process can be slower than necessary, resulting in preventable deaths. Others argue that the FDA serves an important role in preventing harmful drugs from being released to the public, and that even well-intentioned attempts to speed up the approval process can have unintended consequences.\n\nAnother theme that emerges is the complexity of healthcare and how different factors interact to affect patient outcomes. For example, one comment questions whether a drug designed for one condition might have unintended consequences for other health issues. Another points out that there are often many steps involved in getting a drug to patients, and that the FDA is only one of many players in the process.\n\nThe comments also touch on more specific healthcare issues, such as the efficacy of weight loss drugs and the use of vitamin D supplements.

Some of the authors push back against the notion that it is possible to fully understand animal perspectives on pain, while others reject the idea that there is a moral difference between killing and torturing animals for human enjoyment. There is also discussion around the prioritisation of addressing different issues affecting animals and humans, with some feeling that addressing human welfare should take precedence. \n\nThe mistreatment of livestock in agriculture is also a topic of discussion, with comments highlighting the painful procedures and unnatural diets that are used to raise animals for human consumption, as well as the mistreatment of downed cattle during transport and slaughter. The safety of feeding dogs cooked bones is also debated, with some surprised by the veterinary advice given to avoid giving dogs cooked bones due to the risk of injury. Overall, the comments reflect a variety of perspectives on animal welfare and the use of animals by humans, with differing opinions on the morality of various practices and the prioritisation of different issues.",

Another commenter notes the happiness of professed Christians and suggests that there may be a way to \u201ccatch belief\u201d for personal improvement. A third commenter argues that while religion has benefits that are testable, existing religions are not fit for the modern age and suggests that efforts should be made to rethink religion within a rationalist framework.\n\nAnother topic addressed in the comments is the concept of justice, with one commenter distinguishing between distributive justice, corrective justice, and criminal justice. Some commenters also discuss the irrationality of arguments and the phenomenon of motivated reasoning. One commenter suggests that many people may be unconsciously being lied to by their motivated reasoning center, making it difficult to argue with them effectively. Another commenter argues that solutions to certain problems, such as arguments over holidays, often go unexplored because the goal is not finding a solution but signaling group affiliation.\n\nTwo final commenters discuss the idea of choice and its opposites. One commenter proposes that the opposites to \u201cchoosing freely\u201d are lacking desires or agency and being under compulsion in a particular situation. Another commenter references Chesterton\u2019s chapter on the cave man to criticize the limited and often inaccurate portrayals of early humans.",

                      "summary": "The comments cover a range of themes, including motivated reasoning, effective altruism, rationality and humility, cognitive biases, moral philosophy, ethics, and unexpected risks. Some commenters express skepticism towards effective altruism as a movement, with one arguing that its core intuition (the Drowning Child scenario) is flawed because it relies on proximity and relational sense, which are fundamental to ethics, but not always applicable to situations outside of the scenario. Meanwhile, another commenter critiques the idea that emotions and highly emotional statements are strong evidence. They point out that emotions are subjective and can be unique to an individual, so rational arguments should be built on stronger foundations. Another commenter evaluates whether rationalists should be better at examining and rejecting inaccurate ideas when trying to achieve long-term goals. They posit that people who are less likely to accept irrational thoughts as valid may be less susceptible to relapse or short-term cravings and distractions.\n\nAnother theme in the comments is the challenge of arguing with people using motivated reasoning, where they come up with a rational-sounding argument for their preferred opinion or action, but the argument is often based on unconscious drives and biases rather than objective evidence. One commenter suggests that people using motivated reasoning may be being lied to by their own unconscious (motivated reasoning) center and thus, different methods of arguing may be more effective. Similarly, another commenter argues that humility for its own sake is pointless and that explicit calls to humility may have negative consequences, such as exerting social control and discrediting those who question established authority or norms.\n\nSeveral commenters also raise concerns about unexpected risks and the unforeseen consequences of well-intentioned actions or technologies, such as the potential pitfalls of a biotech startup or genetically enhancing human intelligence. Overall, these comments highlight the importance of critical thinking, self-awareness, and objective evaluation of evidence when making decisions and engaging in debates. ",

One common theme is the controversy surrounding donations made to EA-funded organizations by FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange run by a fraudulent CEO. Some commenters argue that EA organizations should have done more due diligence before accepting the donations, or called into question the efficacy of EA ideology in light of this scandal. Others defend EA and point out that accepting donations from problematic sources is not unique to EA organizations, and that the scandal highlights the need for effective regulations and due diligence in charitable giving.\n\nSeveral commenters question the efficacy of EA itself, particularly regarding its focus on long-term and speculative causes rather than immediate or more locally-focused issues. One commenter argues that profit-seeking investment may be a better use of funds than charitable donation, while another suggests that EA-led programs are too America-centric.\n\nDespite these criticisms, many commenters express support for EA principles related to impact per dollar and evidence-backed causes, and some even suggest specific charities or causes that prioritize these principles. The general consensus seems to be that while EA is not without its flaws, it offers valuable insights into thoughtful charitable giving, and remains a useful framework for those committed to doing good in the world.",

For example, motivated reasoning is seen as a way of justifying beliefs or actions that one wants to defend, and people may use emotions or biased thinking to support their arguments. This makes it difficult to change people's minds, as simply presenting evidence may not be enough if the underlying motivation for their beliefs is not addressed.\n\nAnother theme is the relationship between rationality and values or ethics. Some commenters argue that rationality is a way of processing and communicating information, but it is not necessarily a complete system of values. Others note that rationality can be used to justify particular values or belief systems, and that people must be aware of their own assumptions and biases in order to be truly rational.\n\nFinally, there is discussion around willpower and how it can be used to achieve goals. Some argue that willpower is a limited resource and that it is best to find ways to motivate oneself, rather than relying solely on willpower. Others suggest that using social disincentives, such as shaming, can be effective in encouraging people to behave in certain ways. Overall, the comments suggest that rationality is a complex and multifaceted concept that is intertwined with a range of ethical, psychological, and social issues.",

One recurring theme is the discussion of ideological influence on academia and how it came to be. Some commenters point to the activism of the 60s and 70s and the popularity of Marxist theory among academics during that time. Others question the validity of claims that academia has been taken over by leftists without a clear explanation of how it could have happened.\n\nAnother theme is the interpretation of history and how different schools of thought approach historical analysis. One commenter questions the Marxist approach to class struggle and whether it's merely a methodological choice or a serious empirical claim about human behavior. Others explore the accuracy of historical narratives, such as the idea that witches did not exist or the romanticism of the cave-man archetype.\n\nFinally, some commenters respond to specific arguments or points made by the author, such as criticisms of Harvey's book or curiosity about a relatively unknown philosopher. Overall, the comments demonstrate a range of perspectives and opinions on a variety of issues, reflecting the complex and diverse nature of online discourse.",

Another commenter argues that justice, in the traditional sense, entails distributive and corrective justice, rather than a focus on criminal justice; this commenter asserts that the notion of \"justice creep\" conflates a Christian understanding of justice with a wider lens to identify and address social injustice. A third commenter posits that opportunities for cultivating virtues can coexist alongside remedying injustices. \n\nHowever, some commenters suggest that evaluating injustices depends on the context, as what constitutes an injustice varies with differing levels of privilege or relative power in society. Another commenter questions the origins of \"social justice\" and its specialized meaning, while yet another argues that the concept of \"punching down\" relies on an unstable hierarchy of power and is not an intersectional approach to addressing inequalities. Overall, the comments express a range of viewpoints on the nature and interpretation of justice, with some calling for a broader awareness of societal inequalities and others emphasizing the importance of cultivating virtues beyond remedying injustices.",

One thread is focused on the holiday Columbus Day and how it should be renamed or celebrated. One commenter argues that simply changing the name to Indigenous Peoples Day without fundamentally changing the holiday's focus on Columbus does not effectively address the concerns of those who see Columbus as a symbol of genocide and oppression. Another commenter agrees that the holiday is problematic but questions the motives of those who are advocating for a change. They suggest that the argument over the holiday may be less about addressing societal issues and more about finding ways to signal one's political affiliation or virtue.\n\nA separate thread in the comments concerns the concept of hate and its place in political discourse. One commenter takes issue with another's statement that they hate those who do harm and believes that it is an unhealthy mindset. They explain that they do not want their enemies to suffer but rather want their harmful behavior to stop. Another comment dives into the topic of the use of language to describe violent events and raises concerns about how terms like \"massacre\" are used in political language. The commenter argues that using these terms too loosely dilutes their meaning and makes it harder to effectively address actual atrocities.",

Another argues that claims about the \"Ferguson effect\" on crime after incidents of police brutality oversimplify complex factors affecting community-police relations and public trust. Similarly, several authors criticize the use of selective data and insinuations to make sweeping claims about differing rates of crime and homicide in different countries or regions.\n\nAnother theme is the importance of considering multiple factors when analyzing crime statistics, such as unemployment, drug trafficking, and police presence. Some authors point out that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns on crime rates are multifaceted and difficult to track, and that simplistic explanations based on single variables are not sufficient. Similarly, some authors challenge the assumption that homicides and shootings are a uniform category, pointing out the different dynamics and causes of high-school shootings versus gang violence or drug-related crime.\n\nFinally, some authors stress the importance of using rigorous statistical methods to establish causality and avoid overgeneralizing or cherry-picking data. One author critiques the use of time series data as lacking in methodology and providing weak evidence for causal claims, and another argues against using simplistic geographic correlations to explain the wide variation in gun-related deaths.

One observes that a new bill requires doctors to verify athletes' sex characteristics. They predict that students will not be subjected to the tests because they are unnecessary and irrelevant. Another discusses the interpretation of the ninth amendment and its role in limiting the federal or state government's power to pass new laws.

One commenter suggested that even on a low day, a happy parent's well-being is still higher than an average day for someone without children. \n\nFinally, a few commenters discussed the limitations of studies on genetics and occupation. One person raised the issue of measuring whether a child has a certain occupation because their parent did, or if a parent has an occupation because their child does.

Parenthood and child-rearing are prominent, with some expressing concerns over how to best teach children and find reliable resources on parenting, while others reflect on the impact of parenthood on their empathy. Another theme concerns societal changes over time, with some wondering about the psychological differences between people of the past and present, while others are shocked by how disruptive recent events have been. Finally, there are discussions of fear and hysteria, with some wondering about the mechanisms behind such reactions and others questioning whether certain fears and concerns are valid. While the comments cover a wide range of topics, these themes show some commonalities and shared concerns among the authors.",
